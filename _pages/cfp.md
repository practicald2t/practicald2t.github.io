# Call for Papers

### Workshop topic and content
Practical D2T 2024 will be a full-day in-person-only event. We welcome contributions from both original unpublished work and non-archival submissions, in the form of long (8 pages) or short (4 pages) papers, on topics including but not limited to:

- Design, implementation and evaluation of LLM-assisted D2T systems
- Cross-domain adaption of LLMs for D2T
- User perceptions and acceptance of LLM-generated text in D2T
- Bias, fairness and red-teaming issues in LLM-assisted D2T systems
- Leveraging LLMs for D2T in low-resource languages and domains
- Error analysis and debugging techniques for LLM-assisted D2T
- Human-in-the-loop approaches for improving LLM-assisted D2T
- Comparison between LLM-assisted D2T and traditional symbolic approaches

### Special Track: Neuro-Symbolic D2T
Research is currently seeing a renewed interest in developing systems combining neural and symbolic approaches to improve explainability and reduce dependence on training data. Practical D2T 2024 will feature a special track on neuro-symbolic approaches to D2T. Submissions for papers in the special track follow the same requirements and procedure as the main workshop submissions.

Choose the appropriate *submission type* (Long/Short Paper), *track* (Main/Neuro-Symbolic D2T) and *Proceedings Type* (Archival/Non-Archival).

All submissions must follow the submission template and guidelines issued by INLG 2024.

<!---Participants of the shared task will send their submission through $TODO_CODALAB_EMAIL_OR_BOTH_? with the subject "[Submission] {title of your work}" before the submission deadline (see below)--->
