| 09:30–09:40 | **Workshop Introduction** |
| 09:40–10:40 | **Invited Talk 1**<br> <br> Title: Remaining challenges in complex data-to-text generation<br>by **Craig Thomson**, ADAPT/DCU<br> <br> <em>In 2017, Wiseman et al. explored the ability of then state-of-the-art neural sequence-to-sequence (seq-2-seq) models to generate texts that were more complex than the short, descriptive texts seen in most datasets.  Since then, a lot has changed, with Large Language Models (LLMs) upending the field of Natural Language Processing, and alleviating some of the issues seen in outputs of seq-2-seq models.  However, LLMs still make mistakes, and identifying the conditions under which these are made is an open question.  This talk will explore the problems that persist when trying to build complex data-to-text systems using neural systems.  It will cover the SportSett dataset of basketball game data, which was designed to enable exploration of this problem in a realistic setting.  LLMs are well positioned to take advantage of the large amount of data available in SportSett, investigating problems that were obscured by an abundance of simple errors in seq-2-seq model output.  Also covered are methods for identifying factual accuracy mistakes in system outputs.  The talk will conclude with some examples of mistakes that ChatGPT still makes when writing data-to-text sports summaries, and the interesting research avenues that this leaves.</em><br> | <img src="/assets/images/2024/Craig Thomson - fit.png" alt="ALT: Invited speaker propic" width="1500" height="2100"> |
