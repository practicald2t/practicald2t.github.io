*Playing with large language models can be fun. But what if your really need them?*


## Hackathon
Bring your own laptop, programming skills, and open mind. In a team of 3-5 people, you will have 6 hours to build a system for **data-to-text generation**.

What kind of data, and what kind of text? To give you an idea, imagine automatically generating weather forecasts based on weather data, or sports report based on match statistics. 

Such a system often takes years to build. But you will be allowed to use the newest nightmare of high-school teachers: **large language models**‚Ñ¢ ü¶ú. 

Can you use build a pipeline so that the system outputs **fluent and accurate texts**?


## Poster Session
We invite participants to submit their work which will be presented as a poster during the hackathon. Our workshop is **non-archival**, meaning that the paper will not appear in the conference proceedings.

The topics may include:
- innovative **datasets** and **benchmarks** for data-to-text generation
- way of **integrating language models** in data-to-text generation systems,
- comparing **neural-based** and **rule-based** data-to-text generation.

## For participants
### Hackathon
Please, indicate your interest in the hackathon by filling the following üëâÔ∏è **Google Form** (TBA) before **1¬†September 2023**.

Note that the goal of the hackathon not to win (or even build a well-functioning system), but to get acquainted with large language models and bootstrap future research projects. Feel free to apply regardless of your skills or competitive abilities!

### Poster session
- **Paper submission deadline**: 15 July 2023
- **Acceptance notification**: 15 August 2023

Note that submitting a paper is optional, i.e. even without an accepted paper you can still participate in the hackathon.
